# DATA ANALYTICS #2
## Statistics for Data Science
### Introduction to Statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
### Types of Statistics
   - __Descriptive Statistics__
     
     Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide a clear and concise overview of the data without making inferences or drawing conclusions beyond what is directly observed.

     - Distribution

       Distribution describes how values are distributed for a field. In other words, the statistical distribution shows which values are common and uncommon.

     - Skewness
    
       Measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images. A distribution can have right (or positive), left (or negative), or zero skewness. A right-skewed distribution is longer on the right side of its peak, and a left-skewed distribution is longer on the left side of its peak

      - Correlation Coefficient
        
        Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate). It’s a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect
     
   - __Inferential Statistics__

     Inferential statistics involve making predictions, inferences, or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. This type of statistics is used when you want to draw conclusions about a larger group (population) based on a smaller subset (sample). Key methods and concepts in inferential statistics include:
     
     - Hypothesis Testing

        This is the process of formulating and testing hypotheses about a population based on sample data. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
         - alpha is the level of risk you are willing to take in ignoring H0. The alpha value is generally set at 0.05 or 0.01.
         - The p-value is the probability of observing a result that is at least as strong as the test statistic when H0 is true. If the p-value is smaller than alpha, then H0 can be rejected.

     - Confidence Intervals
     
       Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to fall, based on sample data.

     - Regression Analysis
     
       Regression techniques are used to establish relationships between variables and make predictions. Linear regression, logistic regression, and multiple regression are common methods.

     - Probability Distributions
     
       Probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution, are used to model and understand random variables and their properties.

     - Sampling Methods

       Techniques for selecting representative samples from a population, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, are essential for making accurate inferences.

     - Estimation

       Estimation methods are used to estimate population parameters, such as means or proportions, based on sample data. Point estimates and interval estimates (confidence intervals) are commonly used.

### Outliers
- Difference Outliers and Anomalies

  Outliers are observations that are distant from the mean or location of a distribution. However, they don’t necessarily represent abnormal behavior or behavior generated by a different process. On the other hand, anomalies are data patterns that are generated by different processes or wrong input.

- Example Outliers and Anomalies
  
  - Outliers
  - 
    When data has an average age of 28 years. However, the data has value grandfather is 70 years old and the baby is 1 year old. Data with numbers 70 and 1 are Outliers values. Because it is beyond average.

  - Anomalies
  - 
    If a data input enters a person's age of -20 or 10,000 years, it can be called an anomaly. Because it doesn't make sense that age is minus 10,000 years.

- How to check Outliers and Anomalies

  - Anomalies
    
    We can use the describe() function in Python. Then, we look at the maximum and minimum values. If there is something absurd in that value, it is called anomalies.

  - Outliers
  
    There are two ways to check outlier values:

    1). Boxplot Diagram Insert a boxplot diagram using the seaborn library. We can use syntax `sns.boxplot()`
   
    2). Use IQR Steps check outliers use IQR:

      - Choose the data to be checked for outliers
      - Finding first quartile and third quartile
      - Finding the IQR which is the difference between third and first quartile
      - Find lower and upper bound
      - Values below lower bound and above upper bound are outliers.
        
    3). Handling Outliers

       To handle outliers, we can select data above the lower bound and below the upper bound. In this way, outlier data will delete.

### Handling Missing Values
Before handling missing values, we need to determine the type of data to handle. Including numerical or categorical. After this, we can choose way to handling missing values:
- If numerical

  We can use median values ( Curtois or Skewness Distribution )
- If categorical

  We can use mean values ( Normal Distribution )

### Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of representing data graphically through various types of graphs and plots to aid in the understanding and communication of the information contained in the data.

- __Matplotlib__

  Matplotlib is one of the most popular data visualization libraries in the Python programming language. Matplotlib provides various types of plots that can be used to visualize data in various ways. Several types of plots commonly used in Matplotlib:

  - Line Plot

    This is the simplest plot that connects data points with a straight line. It is used to depict trends or changes along the X-axis.

  - Scatter Plot
 
    Used to describe the relationship between two numerical variables. Each data point is plotted as a point in two-dimensional space.

  - Bar Plot

    Used to compare quantity or frequency between several categories or variables.

  - Histogram
 
    It is used to describe the frequency distribution of numerical data. The data is divided into "bins" or "classes" and the amount of data in each bin is plotted.

  - Pie Chart

    Used to compare proportions or parts of a whole.

  - Box Plot

    To describe the distribution and central trend of data and identify outliers.

  - Heatmap

    Used to describe data in matrix form with color. This helps visualize correlation patterns or relationships between two variables.

- __Seaborn__

  Seaborn is a Python library built on Matplotlib and designed specifically for statistical data visualization. Seaborn provides a more high-level, easy-to-use interface for creating beautiful and informative data visualizations.
